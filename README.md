# Swift Overview

## Variables and Constants

- Variables in Swift are declared using the "var" keyword. They can be assigned a value when declared and can be changed later.
- Constants in Swift are declared using the "let" keyword. They must be assigned a value at the time of declaration and their value canot be changed.

### Data types:
- **Int**: Used to store whole numbers.
- **UInt**: Unsigned integer, used for non-negative whole numbers.
- **Double**: A 64-bit floating-point number. Used when you need high precision.
- **Float**: A 32-bit floating-point number. Used when precision isn't as critical.
- **Bool**: Represents a value that is either `true` or `false`.
- **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.
- **Character**: Represents a single character.

## Control Flow
Control flow can be implemented in swift using For loops, While loops and Switch statements. Control flow also includes conditional statements.

### If - else statements
```swift
if condition {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else if anotherCondition {
    // code to execute if anotherCondition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if both conditions are false
}
```
### Switch statemets
```swift
switch value {
case pattern1:
    // Code to execute if value matches pattern1
case pattern2:
    // Code to execute if value matches pattern2
default:
    // Code to execute if value doesn't match any pattern
}
```
### For - in loops
```swift
for item in sequence {
    // Code to execute for each item in sequence
}
```
### While loops
```swift
while condition {
    // Code to execute as long as condition is true
}
```
